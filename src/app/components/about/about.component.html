    Hello! I'm Nathan, a passionate and versatile full-stack software engineer with a penchant for crafting seamless and
    engaging user experiences. Over the course of my dynamic career, I've had the privilege of contributing my skills to

    When I'm not coding you can find me playing guitar, digging deep into my latest fantasy novel, gaming, playing Magic, 
    and hanging out with my four-legged doofus, Beesly.
